# ✅ Logo Fix & Auto Backend Setup Complete!

## 🖼️ **Logo Issue Fixed!**

✅ **What was wrong**: Logo files were in `/img` but needed to be in `/public/img`  
✅ **What I fixed**: Moved all images to the correct location  
✅ **Result**: Your logo should now appear in the navbar!  

### **Files moved:**
- `/img/logo.png` → `/public/img/logo.png`
- `/img/icon.png` → `/public/img/icon.png`
- `/img/icon.jpg` → `/public/img/icon.jpg`
- `/img/verified.png` → `/public/img/verified.png`

## 🚀 **Auto Backend Setup Created!**

I've created **two powerful scripts** for you:

### **1. `start-full-app.bat` - One-Click Full Stack**
- ✅ Automatically starts both frontend AND backend
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:5001  
- ✅ Sets up Python environment automatically
- ✅ Installs all dependencies

### **2. `dev-menu.bat` - Developer Menu**
- 🎯 Interactive menu with all options
- 🚀 Start full app, frontend only, or backend only
- 📦 Build for production
- 🌐 Deploy options
- 🛠️ Install/update dependencies

## 🎯 **How to Use:**

### **Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
start-full-app.bat
```
**Result**: Both frontend and backend start automatically!

### **Developer Menu:**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
dev-menu.bat
```
**Result**: Interactive menu with all options!
